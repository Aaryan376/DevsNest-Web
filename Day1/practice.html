        <p>Subject : Permission for organizing coding bootcamp by DevNest</p>
        <p>Sir,</p>
        <p>It is to draw your kind attention towards the organization of a coding bootcamp by DevNest in our college from 1st June to 31st July. 
        During this pandemic crisis where students are locked down in their home, it is a good way to help students to learn from their
        home as it would give them a great knowledge about prevalent technologies and would prepare them for the future. The students 
        would be given a pool of knowledge about web development and DSA to make them job ready.</p>

        <p>Moreover, there will be doubt sessions by the mentors and AMA sessions by industry experts on weekends. The proposed 
        schedule for the coding bootcamp is presented below : </p>
